Hi there!

This blog discusses various topics, have a look at the tags to see an overview. Some topics that
I write about here are:
 * Security: How to keep your data and accounts safe
 * Privacy: How to keep yourself private
 * Raspberry Pi DYI projects (sometimes privacy / security focused)

During my regular life I am a scientist, so many of these topics are flavored with a scientific / tech savy audience in mind. 

At the moment, I don't know yet where this blog will go. Maybe you find something useful here, maybe
it's just for myself as a digital memory on how I set various things up.

Note that I probably have implemented and tested everything that is on here. However, if things change
I will add posts to the archive which are no longer valid / recommended. I will also mark archived / 
outdated posts in the title of the post, but leave the rest untouched for archivation. These are at least my rules for now, things are fluid.

Your privacy: I do not collect any data on you, I do not have google analytics activated. At the moment, my blog is however on github and github might have certain trackers. I deactivated things (to the best of my knowledge), but you should go ahead and check out what scripts are running on this webpage. A blogpost on how to do so and best practices will be coming up.

This all being sad: I don't do many things on Windows, so you won't find OS specific things on Windows. However, many posts should be transferable to other operating systems, unless otherwise noted. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, feel free to contact me at:  
436p2q 'at' masqt.com

I will surely get back to you, if just to have a discussion, or if you'd like to propose a topic to be covered / have an idea that you'd like to see here, feel free to ask as well :)
