# Welcome

Hi there! Welcome to my new website. If this is the only post available, then there's not all that much here just yet, but more to come. Have a look at the [about](/about) section on what this blog will be about. 

<!--more-->
The main things to get here soon are my thoughts and implementation on:
 * Security
 * Privacy
 * DIY electronics

My main focus is on bringing these topics closer to scientists and to help people understand common attack vectors and data loss avenues.

I wish you all the best for 2020, stay safe!
